# IMU Devices

!!! warning "Work in Progress"
    Support for IMU devices is still work-in-progress, A clean API for interfacing with various IMU devices is still being considered, the IMU-9150 driver class is effectively a Java port of the InvenSense C library hence has no object orientation. The [RTIMULib from Richards-Tech](https://github.com/richards-tech/RTIMULib2) could be a good starting point.
