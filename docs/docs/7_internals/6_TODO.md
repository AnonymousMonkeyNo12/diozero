# To-Do

* Thorough testing (various types of devices using each service provider)
* A clean object-orientated API for IMUs
* Remote API for board capabilities
* SPI support for Arduino devices
* Introduce Servo as a device type
* Try out ConfigurableFirmata - is there actually any difference to the StandardFirmata protocol?
* Complete ADSL1x15
* BME680
* DONE Native support for all devices via mmap (/dev/mem), in particular to improve performance and add support for GPIO pull up/down configuration.
* DONE Wireless access to Firmata devices (network and Bluetooth). E.g. [ESP32](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp32-thing-hookup-guide?_ga=1.116824388.33505106.1471290985#installing-the-esp32-arduino-core) [Firmata GitHub issue #315](https://github.com/firmata/arduino/issues/315)
